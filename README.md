## Overview

This repository contains the slides from the presentation _Exploring complexity with agent-based models_, delivered on August 15, 2024, at the [1st Meeting on Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Climate Change](https://resiclima.com.br/15/10/2025/recife-recebe-encontro-multidisciplinar-sobre-mudancas-climaticas/) organized by the [Resiclima Network](https://resiclima.com.br).

The slides are available [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/resiclima-pres-2/).

A recording of the presentation, recorded on October 10, 2024, is available [here](https://youtu.be/WPkbsb4eCFE).

## Usage

This presentation was created using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system and the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language. To build the slides locally, you will need to have these tools installed on your computer.

The [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) R package is used to manage the R package dependencies. To install the required packages, run the following commands in your R console before rendering the slides:

```r
# install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

After installing the dependencies, you can render the slides by executing the following command at the project root directory in your terminal:

```bash
quarto render
```

This will generate the slides in the `docs` directory.
