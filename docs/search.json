The modeling cycle must be started with the most simple model possible, because we want to develop understanding gradually, while iterating through the cycle. A common mistake of begin- ners is to throw too much into the first model version—usually arguing that all these factors are well known and can’t possibly be ignored. The modeling expert’s answer to this is, yes, you might be right, but—let us focus on the absolute minimum number of factors first. Put all the other elements that you think might need to be in the model on your “wish list” and check their importance later (Railsback & Grimm, 2019, p. 8)."
